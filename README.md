This [project](http://spaceappschallenge.org/project/moonville-saga/) is solving the [Bootstrapping of Space Industry](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry/) challenge.

The _**Moonville Saga**_ is a collection of short stories and games about our future efforts to colonize the moon.

I believe that in order to inspire and educate our kids to reach for the stars we need stories. By co-creating and collecting many small stories and games around this theme we get a thicker, more compelling context for getting to work.
