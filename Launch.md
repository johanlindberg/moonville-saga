## Launch

Usually there's a long line of people telling me what to do. Media. Politicians. Even friends and neighbours. Everyone is an expert - but not today.

I don't blame them though. It's a hell of a decision that has to be made, and as the COO of Luna Mining Initiative, "the honour falls on me" as our CEO, Michael, put it. The blame as well, was my first thought, but I didn't say anything. Just nodded.

_Never mind that now._

I come prepared. My team has run thousands of simulations, we've analyzed just about everything, everyone and every possible scenario that we've been able to think of. Well, not the one where our operation is being sabotaged by Martians, but everything else.

Everything points to the fact that our founders' vision is not only possible, but also, at least financially, a good idea. There's a lot of Helium-3 for the taking on the moon's surface. Research in nuclear fusion is showing steady progress and the world sure needs a better source for power. Politically and legally is a different issue. But that's not *my* headache. Michael hired a lot of suits to deal with that and I don't mind not bothering.

I just need to get a Helium-3 mining and processing operation fully working on the moon. Prefferably low-cost and highly efficient. Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?

The basic idea, as I've explained it to my husband and my kids, is that we'll launch a minimum amount of technical "stuff" to the moon and use lunar materials to build more technical "stuff" until, eventually, we have enough to go digging up the moon, extracting Helium-3 and sending it back to Earth.

_Easy._

We're considered a high-cost, high-risk, high-payoff investment by our founders. It helps a little that the people backing us are dollar-gazillionnaires or something. A bunch of tech-people raised on Star Wars, who've made enough money not to fuss about a few millions here and there. The devil's in the details though and we've been thinking about what to send and what to build for two years now. The team agrees, a majority of people in other institutions, who actually know a little something about mining and the moon, agree as well.

Still. I'm getting the formal, final, say on what equipment to include on our seeding shuttle. It'll cost a couple of trillion dollars to get to the moon and basically we'll have locked in on a strategy for building the operation so that's what I'll have to play with the coming years.

Only problem is. What the hell am I going to type in as a commit comment when I seal the deal?

_Enough of this. Let's do it._
